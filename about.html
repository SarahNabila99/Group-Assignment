Who are we?

</h2>


<h3>
<center>
<body>
Unlike traditional retailers that tend to markup their prices, we keep our prices low.

<h3>We bridge the gap between quality jewellery and affordability so you can enjoy the same top-notch craftsmanship as high-end brands, but at a fraction of the prices</h3>

<h3>While we adorn you with jewellery, mother nature is also on our mind.</h3>


<h3>We want to minimise the detrimental effects of packaging on the environment, so we choose to use sustainable and reusable packaging.</h3>


<h3>Corrugated boxes are used to deliver your jewellery, eliminating the need for plastic bubble wrap as the boxes are sturdy enough to protect your delicate jewellery from any delivery mishaps. The great thing about corrugated boxes? They are recyclable, renewable, and made from 70% - 100% of recycled material.</h3>


<h3>Inside the delivery box, your jewellery is packed in a plush velvet pouch or our signature gift box. Opt for velvet pouches because less paper means less trees are cut down.</h3>


<h3>Our stylish velvet pouches can be repurposed and reused to store and carry anything you like! (absolutely anything!)</h3>


<h3>Ethics + Aesthetics = Sustainable Fashion</h3>
